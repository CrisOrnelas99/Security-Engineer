# What I Learned — Identification vs Authentication (Key Notes)

- **Identification** is when a user (or system/process) **claims an identity**.
  - Example: saying your name or entering a username/email.
  - Identification does **not** prove the identity is real.

- Identification can be done using:
  - **Usernames** (formats vary by system/org)
  - **Unique numbers**, such as:
    - National ID number
    - Student ID number
    - Passport number
    - Mobile phone number
  - **Email address** is commonly used because it is usually **unique**, making registration easier.

- **Authentication** is when the system **verifies** the claimed identity.
  - It confirms the user is who they say they are (e.g., password, ID card, MFA).
  - Example: gym receptionist asking for your ID to confirm you’re a real subscriber.

- Why authentication matters:
  - Prevents people from gaining access by just claiming an identity.
  - Without it, systems can be abused (e.g., fake loan identity, email access with only an email address).
  - Most real-world systems depend on authentication (banking, reservations, flight systems).
