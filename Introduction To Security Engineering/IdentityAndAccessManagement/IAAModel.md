# What I Learned — IAAA Model

- **IAAA** stands for:
  - Identification
  - Authentication
  - Authorisation
  - Accountability

- These are the **four pillars of information security**.
- They help ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- **Identification**
  - User claims an identity.
  - Done using a unique identifier:
    - Username
    - Email address
    - ID number
  - It answers: *Who are you claiming to be?*

- **Authentication**
  - Verifies the claimed identity.
  - Confirms the user is who they say they are.
  - Methods:
    - Password
    - Email code
    - Multi-factor authentication
  - It answers: *Can you prove it?*

- **Authorisation**
  - Determines what the user is allowed to access.
  - Based on roles, permissions, or clearance levels.
  - Limits access to only what is necessary.
  - It answers: *What are you allowed to do?*

- **Accountability**
  - Tracks and logs user activity.
  - Ensures users are responsible for their actions.
  - Logs help investigate incidents.
  - It answers: *What did you do?*

- IAAA prevents:
  - Unauthorised access
  - Data breaches
  - Internal and external misuse

- Together, these four stages secure systems and protect sensitive resources.
