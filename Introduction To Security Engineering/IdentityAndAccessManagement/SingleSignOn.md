#  What I Learned — Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Users need access to many work resources (email, shared files, printers), which usually means many logins.
- Managing many usernames/passwords is hard, especially if users do not reuse passwords.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** lets a user:
  - Log in **once** with one set of credentials
  - Gain access to multiple required systems/services

- Why SSO is useful:
  - **One strong password:** easier to remember one strong password than many.
  - **Easier MFA:** MFA is configured once (not separately for every service).
  - **Simpler support:** password resets and account issues are tied to one account.
  - **Efficiency:** user doesn’t need to log in repeatedly for each service.
